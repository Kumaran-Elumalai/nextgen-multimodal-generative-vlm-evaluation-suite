# 🧠📸 Vision–Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering

Modern AI systems are increasingly **multimodal**, capable of processing and generating information from diverse sources such as **images and text**.  
This project focuses on **Vision–Language Models (VLMs)** designed to combine visual and textual understanding for:

- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**
- **Descriptive image generation and captioning**

## 🚀 Overview

This repository demonstrates practical multimodal AI development by implementing two advanced VLMs:

### 🔹 ViLT – Vision-and-Language Transformer
- Lightweight and optimized for CPU-friendly deployment  
- Fast inference  
- Ideal for **single-word or short-answer VQA**

### 🔹 SmolVLM – Small Vision-Language Model
- Generates multi-sentence, descriptive responses  
- Great for **detailed image understanding and explanation**

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to provide:

- ✔️ **End-to-end multimodal pipelines** for image + text reasoning  
- ✔️ **Efficient CPU-based inference** without requiring GPUs  
- ✔️ **Clean, professional, interactive AI demos** showcasing real-world VQA and multimodal capabilities
